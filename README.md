**Raspberry Pi Image Captioning with BLIP**

Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Image Captioning project! This repository contains an ongoing project that uses a Raspberry Pi camera to capture images and applies the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model to generate captions for those images.

Overview

This project leverages the power of the BLIP model from Salesforce, integrated with a Raspberry Pi, to perform real-time image captioning. The setup includes capturing images using the Raspberry Pi camera and processing them with the BLIP model to generate descriptive captions.

Pipeline

The project follows a colorful and efficient pipeline:

Step 1: Image Capture

Description: The Raspberry Pi camera module captures a high-quality image.

Step 2: Image Processing

Description: The captured image is processed and converted to a suitable format for the BLIP model using Python libraries like PIL.

Placeholder: 

Step 3: Caption Generation

Description: The BLIP model generates captions based on the processed image, either conditionally or unconditionally, using the Transformers library.

Step 4: Output Display


Description: The generated captions are displayed or saved for further use.
